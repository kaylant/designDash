This project was a further extension of [Color Palette](https://github.com/kaylant/city-color-palette-generator). 

If you have ever been stuck on where to begin designing or communicating your vision for a website or app, Design Dash is a lightweight prototyping tool built to delight and aid in the aesthetic process. 

Begin by searching for anything that inspires you‚ÄìMachu Picchu, Aurora Borealis, or mint-chocolate-chip ice cream. A custom color palette will be generated based on the results of your image search.

From there, choose amongst curated font collections and icon sets.

View a simulation of your project on a mobile device that is scalable to instantly toggle between multiple screen sizes and view types.

When you are satisfied with your chosen colors, fonts, and icons, export a CSS SASS file pre-loaded with your selections to jump start your project, or hand off to a developer!
